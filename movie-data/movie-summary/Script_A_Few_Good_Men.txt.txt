two marines, corporal harold dawson                          and private louden downey, entered                          the barracks room of a pfc william                          santiago and assaulted him.
softball field - day               the right man for the job               his name is lieutenant junior grade daniel allistair kaffee,                and it's almost impossible not to like him.
sam                         danny --                                     kaffee                         commander, from what i understand,                          if this thing goes to court, they                          won't need a lawyer, they'll need a                          priest.
jo                         this last letter to the naval                          investigative service --               she hands it to kaffee who hands it to sam --                                     jo                              (continuing)                         -- where he offers information about                          corporal dawson's fenceline shooting                          in exchange for a transfer, was just                          a last ditch effort.
kaffee                              (beat)                         those names sound like they should                          mean something to me, but i'm just                          not --                                     jo                         dawson!
the brig - day               and an m.p. is leading kaffee and sam down to dawson and                downey's cell.
and as kaffee and sam walk out the open cell door, dawson                and downey come to attention and snap a salute.
jack ross, a marine lawyer maybe two years                older than kaffee, opens the door and walks in..
ross                              (pause)                         i'm gonna give you the twelve years,                          but before you go getting yourself                          into trouble tomorrow, you should                          know this: the platoon commander lt.
kaffee                              (continuing)                         you know, ross said the strangest                          thing to me right before i left.
the jeep drives on and we                                                                    cut to:               jessep, markinson and kendrick are standing as the lawyers                are led in.
the officers club - day               jessep, markinson, kendrick and the lawyers are seated at a                table in the corner.
a holding room in the brig - night               dawson and downey come to attention as kaffee and jo are led                in.
hold on the four of them for a moment, then                                     kaffee                         commander, i want to talk to corporal                          dawson alone for a minute.
kaffee                         for christ sake, sam, do you really                          think that's the same as two teenage                          marines executing a routine order                          that they never believed would result                          in harm?
the courtroom - day               dawson and downey are at the defense table, ross is his place.
randolph looks at kaffee and ross, then turns to the sergeant                at arms.
kaffee                         you think dawson and downey know it                          was an illegal order?
downey                              (beat)                         he ordered me and corporal dawson to                          give willy a code red.
kaffee                              (to dawson & downey)                         he's right, and from now on, "willy"                          is private santiago.
the jurors, nine                enlisted navy and marine men and women, are in their place,                ross is at his table looking through some papers, and dawson                and downey, in handcuffs, are seated at the defense table.
kaffee                         object --                                     ross                         were dawson and downey?
kaffee                         corporal hammaker, were you in dawson                          and downey's barracks room ten minutes                          after this meeting?
hammaker gets off the stand, and kaffee watches while walks                past dawson and downey.
kaffee                         the defense is willing to concede                          that all 23 witnesses will testify                          substantially as corporal hammaker                          did, if the government is willing to                          concede that none of them were in                          dawson and downey's room at 16:20 on                          august 6th.
kaffee                         lieutenant kendrick, one final                          question: if you ordered dawson to                          give santiago a code red...
kaffee                              (continuing; calling)                         i'm gonna put jessep on the stand.
kaffee                              (continuing)                         kendrick ordered the code red, didn't                          he?
ross looks at kaffee, then jessep, then nods his head "yes"                to randolph.
