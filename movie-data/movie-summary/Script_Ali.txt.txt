these punches are watched by cassius'          eyes in the fifth street gym...studiously studying liston's          feet...straight-line movement...the jab, linear and straight          at us.
fifth street gym - cassius                    past him a short man in a white shirt, angelo dundee, has          entered with a folded newspaper under his arm.
a hallway, the miami convention center - cassius - day                    in a terry-cloth robe, walks faster and faster as dundee and          bundini, bingham and his cameras, pacheco and rudy race to          keep up.
dundee turns away to tear two strips of tape while cassius          and malcolm face into a corner.
but past the faces and the press, what's arrested          cassius' attention and makes him oblivious in his solitude          to all else is the bright 20-by-20-foot place he wants to be          most in all the world: the ring.
cassius rocks left and right, like a tough kid on a corner          ready to rumble.
at the end of the round                    cassius launches a second combination, slams a couple of big          lefts liston's way that rock his head back two times.
cassius merely leans away to          avoid liston, circles and now snaps off a flurry and opens a          cut under sonny's left eye.
extremely close:   cassius clay                    breathing heavily, ignoring the stool and dundee and bundini,          looks around.
