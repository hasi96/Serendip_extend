objective on the doctor's office: the doctor is peering through          a lightscope into the ear of          an early-middle-aged man, larry gopnik.
objective: the doctor looking through his scope into larry's          eye.
periodically he glances back, giving us a fleeting          look at his face: it is                                                  17          larry gopnik.
he goes to the door, shaking his head, as larry looks on in surprise.
larry stares at the open door.
larry          well-          sarah          mom, how long is uncle arthur staying with us?
still absent, without looking up:          larry          sy?-sy ableman!-that's right, he called, but i-          judy          you didn't talk to him.
he tips the jar          back to drink, his free hand holding a balled-up towel to the          back of his neck          larry stares at him.
his office          larry looks at the messages:          while you were out dick dutton          of columbia record club          called.
later          larry sits in a reclining chair in the living room, head back,          listening to sidor belarsky on          the hi-fi.
we cut to its source: uncle arthur sits scribbling into a spiral          notebook, his free hand          holding the end of a length of surgical tubing against the back          of his neck.
front door          larry enters, glances through the front door's head-height window,          and-freezes, one          hand arrested on the way to the doorknob.
larry's look travels: his point-of-view pans slowly off the steep          angle of father and son          playing catch, travels across his own backyard, and brings in          the white fence that          encloses the patio of the neighbor on the other side.
close on the notebook          its top sheet, densely covered by equations, has a heading:          the mentaculus          compiled by arthur gopnik          after a beat larry's hand enters to turn the page.
arlen finkle          larry, i feel that, as head of the tenure committee i should          tell you this, though it should be no cause for concern.
as she brushes past larry:          sarah          uncle arthur's in the bathroom.
judith          really, to keep things on an even keel, especially now,          leading up to danny's bar mitzvah-          sy          a child's bar mitzvah, larry!
she strokes his hand,          still looking at larry.
larry          i thought i was going to see rabbi nachtner.
larry sits tensely hunched forward facing          rabbi scott.
rabbi's office          we are close on larry.
larry          staring at the rabbi.
rabbi nachtner smiles at larry for a beat.
larry          danny, what's going on!
bedroom          larry enters to look down at danny's back.
arlen finkle          it's okay, larry, we don't need to know!
after a long beat:          larry          maybe rabbi scott was right.
samsky doesn't          react; she looks calmly          down at larry even as the bedroom door opens behind her and clive          park walks in          wearing a traffic mask.
