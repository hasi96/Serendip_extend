the cable still dangles          from the machine, but the force of his fall pulls the          talisman off.
2 eases the bullet away from 9, then smiles gently at 9,          explaining:                                          2 (cont'd)                          (                           quietly)                      some things in this world are                      better left where they lie.
2 (cont'd)                    but if you know where to look,                    these ruins are full of riches.
9 gets a little panicky look on his face at the strange          sounds coming out of him.
muttering to himself as                           he turns the talisman in                           his hands)                      yes, he was always drawing this...
is pov: through his haze and through the broken edges of the          opening to the can, he sees the cat beast grab the talisman          and the struggling 2 in his sharp-toothed mouth, and          disappearing into the smoky mist.
7 (cont'd)                        (to 1)                    there's a path ahead--                    1 looks around calculatingly, like patton: the general taking          charge.
as he turns the map to look at it, the wind picks up and          blows the map out of 5's hands.
the cat beast seems    to be looking for something          in the debris.
they look up and see --                    the cat beast beaming his light from his eye.
9 hangs back to look at the machine          again, and suddenly sees the talisman, lying on the floor.
factory - continuous                    suddenly the cat beast's dead body begins to shift and          move...
2 struggles in the machine's claw but          the strange green energy shoots directly into 2's mouth and          eyes, painfully  his soul.

we pan down, and see seeker drones (that the newly vitalized          fabrication machine has constructed) floating in the air          around the factory, tirelessly looking for enemies.
they wave          their hands and weapons trying to get the machine to come to          the bridge.
looks at the machine.
9 looks over at the little box in the scientist's hand in the          footage, and suddenly                    flash                    9 goes into a startling flashback:                    his pov as he is suspended in the strange machine...
