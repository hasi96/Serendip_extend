(behind the heavy eyeliner and baggy pants of a chola,     rita's really nothing more than a little lost girl.)                               childress                        (knowing full well)                 what the hell's going on here,                 lil' sister?30   int.
trevor lifts his head to see dave childress standing in     the doorway of the bungalow.

cesar, stevie and paco ignore trevor and walk out of the     bungalow.
as they shake right in front of childress' face he can't     help noticing the mean scar on the back of trevor's hand.
as trevor watches     ellen go, childress slides closer to him.
trevor notices cesar sanchez writing on his desk.
trevor looks down at the tagging on cesar's desktop.
the     class empties and trevor is left staring at the empty desks     where benny and cesar sat...
all eyes are fixed on ellen and     trevor.
now trevor stands and faces ellen...
surprisingly, cesar does what he's told as trevor removes     an old pocket watch from his briefcase and sets it next     to snowball's cage...
cesar                         (eyes trevor's pocket                          watch)                  nice watch, homes.
trevor                  rita, give cesar your book.
cesar heaves the book across the room: class erupts,     "refer 'im," "send 'im tuh hyland." trevor walks over     and picks up the book.

trevor                           (off ellen's                            puzzled look)                   what?
trevor                   benny was no saint, ellen.
ellen                   you don't know anything about                   cesar's finger, do you, trevor?
trevor                   did you know cesar hits his                   mother?

trevor stares right into cesar's eyes, unflinching.
