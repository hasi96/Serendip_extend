following him are          his crook friends, the jogger, two middle-aged tourists and a          dancing man in a leotard twirling a big sign reading `cheap          apartment rentals!'                                   like the pied piper, arthur leads his disciples into the bar.
hobson (cont'd)           say goodbye to your new friends,           arthur.
hobson           arthur, you have to stop giving           money away!
manhattan - day                                   arthur and hobson are in a huge bentley.
times square - day                                   hobson's out of the car looking for arthur.
naomi                          (to arthur)           sorry, this pretzel stand is a           watering hole for the crazies.
as the delightful coffee-coloured           gentleman who runs this country           said, `the time has come to set           aside childish things.'                                                   arthur           can't hobson set them aside for me?
arthur (cont'd)           what about naomi?
arthur (cont'd)           let's knock our heads together and           find a way to stop her loving           me....got it!
but susan, burt's beautiful daughter, enters with her best          friend erica - who arthur met whilst at the restaurant the          other night.
bentley - night - continuous                                   arthur and naomi sit in the back of the car, while marty          checks sports results on his pager.
arthur (cont'd)                          (laughing)           naomi, it's okay!
arthur (cont'd)                          (to naomi)           hit the panic button!
manhattan - day                                   arthur is walking naomi along the hudson, this time in          daylight.
manhattan - night                                   arthur and naomi are hand in hand, walking along the street.
arthur gets a a text from hobson: `tell her!'                                                   naomi           hey, richey rich.
night                                   arthur's giving stunned naomi a tour of the huge apartment.
(beat)           anyway, so i went to see vivienne,           and i said `i can't marry susan, i           love naomi she's my frog my toad' i           don't know any more.
hobson (cont'd)           it's going to be okay, arthur.
arthur gets out his phone          and scrolls - past naomi's name, to susan's.
hobson (cont'd)           you're a good son, arthur.
arthur (cont'd)           hobson!
arthur (cont'd)           hobson!
naomi hands arthur her phone.
naomi give arthur a look.
naomi give arthur a look.
naomi           what are we going to do, arthur?
it always was.'                                   arthur looks at naomi, at ralph, at marty.
