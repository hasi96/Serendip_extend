he looks          to his right and left, not a single light perforates the          absolute blackness of the san rafael desert.
day                                   towards us comes aron, upside down, like a tiny, fast spider,          talking all the time, his voice echoing.
aron (cont'd)           and i can sing phish songs as loud           as i like.
aron           (at his most instructor-           ish, talking all the time           as he makes his way down)           you'll have to chimney down a           little ways - like here, watch -           one foot on each wall then squat           onto your right heel, now your           butt's on the wall, so you can move           your right foot across, now put           your left foot under your butt           lower down and scootch your butt           down - watch that black part, it's           slick, slime, try not to get it on           your shoes - if you can get to           these bomber handholds here it's           like an elevator shaft and just           think friction to control the           slide.
the slot is now just 4ft wide and as he stops to look at          massive tree logs jammed at strange angles high above him and          silhouetted against the blue cloudless sky, he drinks deeply          from his water bottle.
he pulls it away as the rock ricochets against the canyon and          careers towards his right arm which he raises, to compensate          for withdrawing the left, and to protect his head.
aron is powerless to stop its          force and he lands on his feet allowing the rock to jam in          front of him with his hand held against the canyon wall by          the stone.
he          hula-hoops out of his backpack to get access to the water,          gulps down 3 full throatfulls - stops mid 4th and backwashes          as much as he can into the bottle -                                                   aron (cont'd)           no, no...
of all these elements - these are now his only companions          and their pov of him reflects that as he tests each one for          its potential, opening all the blades and laying them out to          look at them; sunglasses - scratched, bike ulok key, rock          climbing harness, cloth goggles bag, rapelling equipment,          water bottle, car keys, plastic grocery bag, empty de-          hydration pack, money, credit cards, green and yellow          climbing rope in black zippers bag, a stick, stones and sand.
in a huge close up of this eye he can see in the foreground          that there's a pile of steel filings from the knife itself,          almost as big as the dust from the ground -                          aron           not good.
he pivots and turns to try          and catch it but gravity is quicker than his restricted twist          and it falls into a hole between the rounded rocks near his          left foot -                          aron           no, no!
looking down onto the ground, around his leg, his toes          holding the stick like a chopstick lift the knife out and up          tremulously, breathlessly, towards his good arm.
above aron, looking down into canyon.
aron is very still, looking at the rock and the open blade          lying on top of it.
aron           what you're looking at there is my           arm, going into the rock...
aron           so the third thing left was to cut           my arm off.
a flashing, strobe-ing light - aron's head-lamp bouncing back          and forth off the canyon walls - but also, as he continues to          chip away...
night          aron ducks out of his head-bag and shakes his water bottle.
with the flash           video footage: at night in           aron: i'm holding on but the canyon.
he looks like aron.
aron (cont'd)           there was a little boy,and he           looked like my cousin charlie but           he was too young.
aron (cont'd)           i hate this fucking canyon.
