as theribbon falls out of her hair and down her back,anastasia kicks it to sonya without breaking stride.tatiana sees her and can't help but smile.the music suddenly becomes  a flourish of trumpets.servents open the elevador doors as the royal familysteps out and begins a proccession through theirsubjects.
then,a whirlwind kicks up, sending everyone off the dancefloor, as the whirlwind becomes a tornado.suddenly, an albino bat (bartok) with huge eyes, springsout of the funnel, screeching and swooping over thecrowd, causing everyone to duck and cover their heads infear.the tornada reaches it's peak and explodes in smoke -leaving rasputin standing alone in the middle of thefloor.
connected to the rope is aglowing reliquary, a mystical lantern.various shotsof nicholas, alexandra, sophie and vladimir, dmitripeeking out ofthe wallpanel, tatiana and anastasia,all of whom are frightened.nicholasas he gathers his son and wife to his side                       nicholas          rasputin!
she doesn't see meetoo,running like a little maniac behind her.anya approaches a stern looking building with a signover the door: "the people's bureau of bureaucracy".she leaps off her bike and heads up the stais.
anyonefrom a peasant to a princess will do, as long as she canfool tatiana.</u> <u>(note:   we don't want to give dmitri awhole new song here or we'll be too song-heavy in act i.by giving him a short reprise of anya's song, we caneffectively align these two characters emotionally.)</u>quick cuts:of various aspirants:                       actress 2                  (heavy hasal)          oh, grandmama!
vladimir keeps walking, catching up to dmitri.anya runs back around to the front of the building whereshe left her bike.
(more)                       dmitri (cont.)                  (beat)          and i think you are the          princess anastasia.anya laughs.
as the reliquary picture broadens,we see a train and anya, dmitri and vladimir all hurryingto catch it.
tatiana          haven't anything better to do          than to break my heart.sophie ushers the now ashamed young woman to the door.the young woman looks amazing like anya except that herhair is long and her clothes are now.
vladimir          what a world - a man who was in          my position in society is calling          a peasant 'your highness".dmitri leans over and tugs anya's hair lightly.
anya and dmitri exchange a quick look as thetunnel gets closer - vladimir's stomach is sticking uptoo high to clear the tunnel.
anya catches something out of thecorner of eye and turns quickly.close on a sign: "paris 30 kilometers"anya walks away from dmitri and over to the signand looks at it longingly.
anya         that was really very kind of you.she gives him a kiss on the cheek and walks away withmeetoo, who turns back and gives dmitri a look.
we haven't seen an         anastasia in several days!anya looks to dmitri, a little confused by that lastcomment.
i'll take you home.anya looks lovingly at dmitri and doesn't put the crown back on.
