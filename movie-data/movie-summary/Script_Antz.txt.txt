(over a dark screen) all my life, i've lived and worked in the big city...
an ant mound - day the camera swoops towards the entrance, then dives inside, past a couple of tough-looking soldier ants who stand at the gates of the ant colony like insect bouncers...into an access tunnel that snakes this way and that, past a row of ants plodding along...
we see -- a "traffic cop" directing foot traffic, waving his arms like crazy so both sides move at once -- a column of soldier ants marching along in formation -- a chain of ants letting down a matchbox elevator filled with workers.
motivational counsellor's office - day we join z, a worker ant with issues.
the other ants rush over -- it looks like they're going to help their fallen comrade, but instead, they climb right over him, and pick up the boulder, continuing with their task.
pull out to reveal azteca, a feisty, cynical, female worker ant, who stands there, waiting to pass the dirt on.
i'm going to marry general formica and be a queen and have millions of babies, just like my mom.
ant bar entrance - night princess bala is peering in at the entrance to the ant bar, accompanied by her worried-looking handmaidens.
bala whirls away from them, sets her sights and searches the crowd -- zeroing in on -- z, who's watching the other ants dance.
then they get a little too wild -- and the other ants, who are still doing their intricate dance, start to collide with bala and z.
unfortunately, just at this moment, a soldier pushes weaver...weaver pushes him back...somebody makes a dive for z -- and before you know it, there's a regular bar brawl going on, with weaver in the middle of it, cracking heads together, punching ants in the face, having a great time.
but...just as bala'a about to be rescued...what looks like a gigantic laser beam sweeps along the rim of the colony, sizzling the ground as it moves along...and ignites the lead soldier into flames!
formica we know what makes an ant colony strong, don't we?
ant team six burst in the doors of formica's office, carrying the struggling and kicking bala.
formica princess bala.
formica (shaking his head) princess bala, i'm just a simple old soldier, and the ways of the feminine mind are a little too complex for me.
town center - day the huge main chamber of the colony, where most of the workers -- as well as z, bala, weaver, azteca, and the queen -- have run to.
