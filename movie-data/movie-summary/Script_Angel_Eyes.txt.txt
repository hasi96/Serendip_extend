he is making gentle circles in her hair.sharon watches this, and for a moment her eyes reveal adepth that may be loneliness, but she quickly pushes herthoughts away and hits the horn, startling robby andstartling the people ahead who now disengage and driveon.
(continued)                                                     4.continued:people glance at catch, nad he glances back in an openand unflinching way, ready for anything, a smile, a nod,or -- because these are some of l.a.'s mean streets -- athreatening or taunting look.
catch             right now your mind's making             pictures of me robbing your             groceires, but, y'know, nine times             out of ten, people do the right             thing.the old man glances at him, still not convinced, but hesoon has to stop and rest.
the kid is wild andresisting and sharon shows her toughness andprofessionalism and some anger, too, as she slams himinto a fence -- and robby holds him while she cuffs theyoung man -- who is very mouthy, playing to his friends.
benny,          look at this!sharon and robby are both very good at their jobs, takingthis kid to their car while other cops contain the rest.a crowd watches -- mostly teens.
police car - day (few minutes later)sharon's on the radio to dispatch as robby drives and thekid keeps mouthing off.
police jail parking lot - day (later)as robby and sharon walk to their car.
driver             you better watch your mouth,             asshole.catch meets the man's look with his own unflinching,haunted eyes.
as sharon walks away, we see her forced smile die,replaced by an old pain and darkness.ext.
he frowns, picks up his hammer, goesback to work.on streetas sharon walks towards the car, she sees a vanapproaching and she holds up a hand to robby and callsout...
you're not breaking my             fingers again.they smile and drive on and sharon walks toward her carand robby.ext.
closed store - daya police   car is parked askew near this closed store -- asnow robby   and sharon's unit roars to a stop beside it.two cops   are calling and motioning to them, one holds ashotgun.
ray             no shit!?sharon stares across the lot to where catch has halted.more cops are converging.
you know where the rib             house is?catch glances at sharon again, and he nods.
catch (o.s.)          i tackled a guy.elanora is moving about the living room, picking upframed photographs and turning them face down.
catch and sharon see thecops, staring, smiling, raising their glasses.
and now sharon is moreself-conscious, and a bit tough again, taking her drinkand turning back to catch.
bar - nightas catch and sharon exit the building, walk toward hercar.
catch             what?she says this clipped and fast and even tougher:                       sharon         every time i close my eyes, i see         that goddamn gun pointing at me         and i don't know why i'm telling         you unless it's because you were         there and because i had three         drinks, but i'm not ready to go         inside and close my eyes and i         don't want to go to your place and         i don't want to keep driving         around, so what the hell do we do?
sharon             what i want  is to know how you             happened to  be walking by that             parking lot  at that minute.
catch's apartment - daybefore he can close the door behind him, it bangs openwider, startling him -- and sharon is in the doorway,staring hard at him.
oh, shit.she sits on the edge of a chair, worried, deep in herthoughts, hitting bottom -- the darkness engulfing her.in a moment, she looks at her desk, walks there, opens adrawer, pulls out that piece of tape with catch's numberon it -- but it is all stuck to itself.
(continued)                                                           60.continued:                           sharon             it's you, right?she unlocks   and opens the door, stares at catch, veryvulnerable,   on the very edge, her pain and fear overlarry just   under the surface.
i feel like a             smiley face.catch smiles, sharon frowns, but when an old man passes,she gives a small smile.
go away.sharon laughs aloud and walks (with catch in hand) to thepolice car, her joy overwhelming any embarrassment.
i wasn't even close.but catch is walking     away with that frozen, numb look,all shut down by his     fear and his memory as bob trotsalong beside him and     the biker comes after him and tommyand candace watch him     go and sharon hurries her steps tocatch up.
sharon             catch -- take my hand.
