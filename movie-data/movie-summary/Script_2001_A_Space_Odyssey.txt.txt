pilot					    yes, well, i wouldn't have been					    too concerned about it, except					    i've heard these stories about the					    epidemic and, as a matter of fact,					    i've heard that ten people have					    died already.12/14/65										 b40 b24continued					    floyd					    i wish i could be more helpful,					    captain, but as i've said, i don't					    think there's any cause for					    alarm.
poole					    yesterday, i finally called the					    accounting office at mission					    control, and all they could tell me					    was that they'd received the ags-19					    notification for the other three but					    not mine, and apparently not yours					    either.12/14/65										 c13 c12continued					    bowman					    did they have any explanation for					    this?

the earth isperfectly centred.c66centrifuge					    poole					    there's nothing wrong with it at					    the moment.12/13/65										 c68 c66continued					    hal					    no, it's working fine right now,					    but it's going to go within seventy-					    two hours.
hal					    i'm afraid the ao-unit has failed.bowman and poole exchange looks.
poole					    hal was right all the time.12/14/65										 c88c81continued					    bowman					    it seems that way.
