john		i have someone waiting for me.kyle disappears into the crowd.john moves up...the stairwaya river of brown cassocks running downstream.john is the only one moving against the flow.he exits the stairwell --one floor upa narrow corridor lined with doorways.john moves to one in particular.he doesn't even look as he grabs the door knob.this is his room.he opens the door --in brother john's rooman old, worn out dog lays in wait on an old, worn out cassockwhich is now serving as its bed.at the sight of john it stands.
john	    	    (reading)		in the year of our lord 1348 i, brother		gerhado of the minorite abbey helped bury		the abbot and my sixty fellow monks --			voice o/s		sometimes, i think you'd like that.john turns to find --the abbotleader of the monastery.
he opens the book.reads aloud --			john		in the year of our lord 1348 i, brother		gerhado of the minorite abbey helped bury		the abbot and my sixty fellow monks, day		by day, one by one, until i am the only 		one left.
dead.johnis the first to hit the shore.small leather and wood fishing boats tossed by the wake.his coracle is the first into the water.the others running up behind him.he cannot hear the shouts of warning.on the sea - dawnthe sun cracks over the black water.john's hands move the rough wooden oars.blistered palm opens.blood flows.he tears off a piece of his cassock --rips it with his teeth --wraps the bloody hand.rows.the starship.
he stares at it...a beat.then quickly pulls it down...wuorrrsh -!hull door opens.the doorway is a black maw.john crosses himself.begins to lower his foot into the hatch --			kyle o/s		watch it!he almost falls backwards off the ship.
book resting on his lap.she squints to make the figure standing in the shadowsbehind him -- it's skin picks up and reflects tiny points offlickering cangle light - seems to ripple as it moves --the alienbig, black shiny-smooth head moves into the taper light.it moves towards her, cable-like arms held out at its side --moving out of sync with its feet -- ripley tries to move - to cry out -- she can't.she can only move her eyes.
she can feel his breath -- it evaporates the sweat  on herforehead -- a chill runs through her but she still can't move --the alien stands alongside her bed.extends a six-fingered hand...gently rests it on her stomach.cocks its head -- like it's listening to something.the implication is clear.ripley finds her voice --			ripley		aaaaaaaaaaaargh!her eyes open wide --she sits bolt upright.a hand moves to her forehead.
out of it...ripley falls back, eyes glued to where the alien appeared.john sees her focal point, looks back over his shoulder:nothing.ripley's eyes roll back into her head.she tries to speak -- it was there.her hand, at her side, tightens into a fist --john's hand covers hers.eases the fingers open again.she feels the coarse bandages against her palm.he starts to read quietly from saint augustines' confessions.she begins to drowse again as his soft voice flows over herlike waves lapping against the shore...ext.
ripley's room - dayripley lays with eyes closed.muffled voices outside her door:			abbot		how is the woman, john?
opens her eyes.rolls over onto her side --there is a window right next to the bed.ripley lifts herself up on one elbow, looks out:her povgarden of earthly delights...monks laboring under a beautiful, celestial blue sky --picking apples, fishing on the water on small inland lakes.working with hammer and saw on small wooden cottages.
she scans the countryside...sheep graze around wooden ladders stretching hundreds of feetup to the -- ripley does a take --workers on a scaffoldingwith crude brushes at the end of poles -- paint the sky blue.the abbey, the cottages, the fields outside her window are allon one level - inside the planet.the vaulted ceiling, painted to look like the sky with hugeglass "windows" to allow the sunlight in, is actually theunderside of the planetoid's outer shell.ripley looks back at the monks on the ground:instead of repairing, they are taking the cabins apart, stackingthe wood onto push carts --			ripley		what the hell --?suddenly --the sulaco escape ship appears in front of her.swings past her window suspended by ropes.then disappears up, out of sight.ripley checks her pulse.
a quadroped, its shrunked hind legs struggling to freeitself from the cooling morass of intestines.john can only scream as the most horrible nightmare he canimagine tries to slough off the animal's mortal coil.the hysterical monk, fear overcome with anger at the loss ofhis beloved sandy,  steps in front of the near catatonic medicand instinctively thrusts his pitchfork into the creature --the sharp prongs pierce its still forming body --the creaturewails a high pitched shriek - half alien, half sheep as it isroughly torn from it's nesting place --the monk lifts --it twists at the end of the fork, acid blood dripping onto thewood floor -- each drop bursting into a little pool of fire.the hysterical monk turns to the now raging hay fire --the entire corner of the barn is ablaze --shoves the abomination in --the sheep/alien pops and sizzles as tongues of flame leap up tolap at it's struggling body -- tiny tail whipping about --the creature dies, its fading screams are soon the only soundheard within the barn.
crowd around the edge --john pushes through them - right to the edge --watches as the cage is slowly lowered down...ripley looks directly at john --			ripley		you've sentenced yourselves to 		death!john watches as she disappears down into the darkness...then turns and pushes his way through the crowd --down the hall --the tribunal roomempty now except for the abbot and the tribunal members.they speak in hushed tones.john appears in the doorway, but pauses -strains to hear what they are saying:			bald tribunal monk		...they'll have started before she gets		down to the hermitage level.
his hair is wild, breathing heavy.he shoves the book into his medical bag.pushes aside a box of kindling wood to reveal awooden door set into the timbers of the floor.he opens the door:laddersextending down through huge open areas beneath the upper level.past vast underground viaducts that held up by wooden rafters.beyond that - a great underground sea that marks the center ofthe planet - below that, the cells.and ripley.johncan smell the dank air from the lower tunnels.he must go down -- the hard way.he climbs into the darkness...int.
without some sort of		technology we haven't got a chance.from behind them:			anthony		there is technology.john and ripley turn to look at him.
