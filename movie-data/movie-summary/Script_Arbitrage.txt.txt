robert (cont'd)           now, i'm aware that may seem           uncharacteristic, but maybe it's taken me           sixty years to realize what's truly           important -- and it's you guys so thank           you all very much.
loft apartment - same                                   robert waits in the cold, staring into the camera as julie          watches him from inside the loft, not moving.
jeffrey                          (louder)           ...what's not working is my four           hundred twelve million dollars that's           sitting in your account so you can           pass your audit, the four hundred           twelve million that you needed, you           said, for two weeks, and which has           been languishing now for           (looks down at paper)           thirty-two days, while it could be           elsewhere invested, earning an actual           return, instead of couching the absurd           lie that you're spinning.
robert (cont'd)           i like the size of the paintings, i wanna talk           to you about them in a second.
julie's loft - bedroom                                   and finds robert sitting, looking a little too comfortable.
robert (cont'd)           you know, i'm not the kinda guy who           wants to throw money away but if           you wanna start a business, you           have to project a certain image.
bryer bends his head down to the car's passenger side,          looking off into the distance of the path robert took just          moments before.
jimmy looks over at robert; he's pretty          banged up.
jimmy           you wanna talk to me like that you           can get the fuck outta my car and           you can walk!
robert looks at jimmy, eyes tearing.
robert's office - continuous                                                   brooke           ...the way that this sheet reads, half           of the fund's assets are missing.
robert's office corridor - continuous                                   as brooke exits, she and bryer cross paths.
interrogation room - later                                   jimmy sits across the table from mills and bryer.
jimmy slides over to sit next to robert.
robert (cont'd)           now, you know, your father asked me           to look after you.
robert           i don't know, jimmy.
robert (cont'd)           brooke.
bryer (cont'd)           look: i know you think miller's           your friend.
robert          come on, jimmy, don't fucking lie          to me...
robert           (as jimmy sits)          what plan?
robert                          (sits)          it's not really that simple, jimmy.
robert (cont'd)                          (to syd)           you got jimmy's?
robert                          (long beat)          ellen i don't know what you think          you know...
