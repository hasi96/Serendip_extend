vincenzo (cont'd)                            professor langdon, you have spent ten                            years of your academic life searching                            for the very symbol you now hold in                            your hand.
cut to:                    ext    vatican - street       day                    on the ground now and behind vatican walls, langdon and vincenzo          walk briskly around a corner and are met by ernesto olivetti, a          solidly-built man in his late thirties.
at the monitor,                    langdon and olivetti join rocher and vittoria and stare at the          image on a video monitor -- it's a familiar-looking canister, in          which a metallic drop of liquid shimmers in the middle, suspended.
assembled in the grand office are langdon, rocher, olivetti, and          vittoria.
cut to:                    ext     apostolic palace       day                    the back doors of the apostolic palace bang open and langdon is          ushered out (fast) by olivetti, the head of the vatican police.
an ancient key grinds in an ornate lock, two heavy chains rattle          into place, four swiss guard take position in front of the doors          and at that very moment --                    int      vatican archives      day                    -- two huge, modern glass doors whoosh open, revealing what looks          like a 23rd century library.
chartrand, a twenty-five year old member of the swiss guard          (in a suit and earpiece, not the traditional garb), leads langdon          and vittoria toward the glass enclosures.
cut to:                    int     vatican archives       day                    inside the archive, vittoria is searching the lower shelves while          langdon, on a ladder, digs through folio bins higher up.
int     car day                    olivetti is behind the wheel, vittoria's in front, langdon leans          in from the back seat.
langdon          and vittoria face rocher, olivetti, and half a dozen swiss guard.
as they disappear around the back of the church,          langdon steps up to the large ring, gives it an almighty twist --                    int       santa maria del popolo            dusk                    -- and the heavy door clunks open.
olivetti points to the left          gestures to langdon and vittoria to go to the right.
cut to:                    int      car      night                    close on a map of rome, unfolded in the back seat of a racing car          and spread out over langdon and vittoria's laps.
int     papal office     night                    -- the papal office, where the camerlengo, rocher, olivetti, and          vittoria are gathered again, as are half a dozen other security          officers.
langdon looks to vittoria -- you coming?
there are still half a dozen security officials in          the papal office, but the camerlengo turns and looks at vittoria,          working alone at a desk on the far side of the office.
int     vatican grottoes      night                    vittoria, the camerlengo, and the two swiss guard reach the          entrance to the holy vatican grottoes just as --                    -- their power goes out.
int     santa maria della vittoria       night                    olivetti, langdon, and four other vatican police make their way          into the burning church.
langdon follows the wires up          with his eyes --                    int     sistine chapel       night                                                   camerlengo                           evacuate st.
cut to:                    int   church of illumination    night                    langdon and vittoria creep into the church of illumination, and we          get our first good look at it.
int     papal offices - hallway         night                    chartrand, langdon, and vittoria round the corner and race down          the hallway toward the pope's office, just as --                     -- a bloodcurdling scream comes from behind the closed doors.
peter's basilica          night                    langdon, vittoria, the camerlengo, and two swiss guard are          hurrying across the deserted floor of st.
int     the necropolis        night                    vittoria, langdon, the camerlengo, and chartrand drop down through          an open hole and into an underground city of ancient, winding          streets.
langdon looks over at vittoria.
langdon and vittoria stand to one side as mortati turns and looks          at them.
