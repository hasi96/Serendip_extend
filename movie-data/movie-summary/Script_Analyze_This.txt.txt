warehouse - same time                                        14     paul vitti gets out of his car and walks to the warehouse     with his most trusted soldier, jelly, a hulking bruiser,     and his sidekick jimmy, a tightly-wound ferret with chips     on both shoulders.
vitti, i told 'em i                   don't know anything but they don't                   believe me 'cause that one time i                   said little joe hit dukey and it                   turned out he didn't but i didn't                   know because --                                 jimmy                          (smacks him)                   shut the fuck up!
ben looks totally confused as jelly hustles back to his     car.
ben                  i'm sorry, but i've been alone                  for eight years, now i've finally                  met someone i want to spend the                  rest of my life with and i would                  really like you to meet her                  before we get married.
hospital - moments later                                 21     vitti and jelly come walking out the emergency room exit.
ben starts for his chair, but vitti sits in it first.
vitti                  not fuckin' likely --                                ben                  -- or kill someone else.

ben                   could we define 'fag,' because                   some feelings may come up --      vitti silences him with a wave of his hand.
vitti gives ben a little pat on the cheek, then turns      and exits.

ben                  there's a lot more to it --                                                       (continued)                                                               43.29   continued:    (6)                                               29                                vitti                  no, you're right.

ben looks to vitti, then to marie.
vitti                         (blowing smoke)                  that's an interesting fact i'll                  have to remember if i'm ever on                  'jeopardy.'                                ben                  so tell me about your father.
scott                   ben, there's a lot i'd like to                   say to you, but i'm going to                   skip the big father-in-law                   speech because i know you've                   been married before.
terrace - few minutes later                             40b      vitti, ben and jelly step out.
vitti                  okay, whatever, i just wanted to                  tell you how i feel because i know                  that anger is --     he looks at ben.
ben looks at vitti.
ben watches vitti and mangano cross the room, then turns     to jelly and jimmy.
paretti's - back at table - few minutes later               78     ben and jelly rejoin vitti.
