georges (cont'd)           anne, what's the matter?
silence                                   finally he gets up, heads for the sink, turns on the tap,          wets a tea towel, wrings it out a little, comes back and          places it on anne's face.
georges (cont'd)           (close to tears)           anne...darling...please!
making a sudden decision, he gets up, rapidly crossing the          hallway, he goes into the bedroom where he starts to dress          agitatedly, which takes him quite a lot of time.
he          tries to calm down, takes his chair that has remained beside          anne, sits down and looks at his wife.
anne looks at the towel, then at georges, and shakes her          head, perturbed that she can't understand.
hallway - living room - day                                   the front door is unlocked from the outside, and georges          enters.
hallway - living room - day                                   georges comes out of the kitchen and opens the front door.
finally georges opens the door and pushes anne, in her          wheelchair, into the living room.
he looks at georges, then at anne again, gets up, goes to the          grand piano and plays.
georges          enters, turns round, then goes back along the corridor,          crosses the room, comes through the apartment door into the          hallway of the apartment.
living room - day                                   georges and eva's husband, geoff, around fifty.
bedroom - day                                   with expert gestures, a nurse shows georges how to lie anne          down and put an incontinence pad on her.
georges (cont'd)           come on, anne, you have to eat some           more.
georges sits down beside anne on the bed, takes her hand,          holds her.
bedroom - day                                   georges, standing at the foot of the bed, faces anne and          starts singing.
georges (cont'd)           come on, anne, please.
