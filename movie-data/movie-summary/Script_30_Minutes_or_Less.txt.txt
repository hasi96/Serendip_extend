chet           hey, a nice girl decides to pleasure           me on a weeknight, in her car no           less...i'm not gonna make her feel           like an untouchable.
chet           come on, man, you know i got promoted           to full-time last month.
i guess i'm just having           a hard time accepting you as "the           man." you know, flunking kids, giving           out spite detentions to girls you           wanna fuck, laser pointing at shit.
dwayne and jay have the fridge          open, fixing themselves a cold cut plate.
nice house - day                                   dwayne and jay head out, passing a brand new pickup truck in          the driveway.
jay looks dwayne in the eyes, knows it's all or nothing...
chet          you sneaky son of a bitch...you want          to fuck my sister, don't you?
chet's apartment building - day                                   will screeches away in his car.
it is dwayne                                   wearing a scary fucking gorilla mask                                                   will           what the -                                   will hears something behind him and whirls around -                                   to find jay, also in a gorilla mask, charging at him.
dwayne looks over to where an oversized stuffed bear, rigged          with its own bomb vest, sits on a tree stump 20 yards away.
dwayne gets right in jay's face.
(takes a breath)           i'd like to tell you to get fucked,           but you know what the problem is...i'm           a better man than you.
will opens the door, stops, looks back at chet.
vaughn           well, marisol...what i want is to           get my money, kill that old ass man,           then get the fuck out of here.
dwayne           if you had any vision, jay, you'd           know exactly what i'm thinking about           right now.
minivan - day                                   dwayne and jay watch will hurry out of the datsun.
they all just want to get done with their          shit and go home, when -                                   will and chet burst through the bank doors, guns in hand.
alley - day                                   as will huffs and puffs -                                                   will           chet...i don't know how to tell you           this...but you got a piece of the           car in you.
jay looks pretty affected that dwayne is opening up to him.
jay           no one gets hurt...right, dwayne?
jay's garage workshop - day                                   dwayne tries will's phone again.
dwayne           does this guy know who the fuck i am!?
dwayne           fuck it, jay.
jay's garage workshop - day                                   dwayne looks down at his phone.
dwayne           that's actually...that's a great           fucking idea, jay.
dwayne hands the phone back to jay, who puts it to kate's          ear.
mustang - night - moving                                   will looks over at dwayne, who pulls out his gun and takes          aim.
kate           will, that's -                                                   chet           fucked up.
