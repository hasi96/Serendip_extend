i don't want any more surprises.and as he speaks the alien rises right behind him -- it's big, the ridges on its head indicating a young queen -- it hisses and lunges at the back of his head.the reinforced plastic window between them, which we couldn't see, stops it.as it hits, a thin laser grid buzzes to life, sparks crackling on the alien's face.its bile trails darkly on the glass as it backs off.perez turns to look at it with the others.perezit took a hell of a lot to get us here.gedimanno shit.wren shoots him another look.perezhow soon before this one's ovulating?wrendays.perezis that normal?wrenno way of knowing for sure, but i'd say it's accelerated.(after a moment) we're going to need the supplies.perezthey're coming.

and right back up, at christie's throat before he has a chance to react, squeezing, batting away the ashtray just a trickle of blood coming down her nose --johner cames at her again and she leaps on him, throws him to the ground, snarling,she's gonna rip his throat out with her teeth.wrenripley.ripley looks up and four guards are pointing burners at her.

the door begins to come down, the soldier finishing the sequence and running off.vriess rolls, face set -- the alien a few feet behind, reaching for himan explosion far away rocks the ship -- the hall tilted momentarily, vriess gets a  boost as he rockets downhill, the beast still on him, the door closing, too low for him to clear.
two less-than-human screams fill the room as they briefly disentangle, thrown apart.the beast recovers first, dodging the next blast and going for ripley again.ripley, on her back, reaches behind her, grabs a table leg and with inhuman strength brings the table down on the monster's head.she dives at it as it comes out from under....call shoots as ripley hits the alien, they're both fried as ripley's momentum sends them over a railing and they fall twenty feet -- the alien lands with a spine snapping crunch,ripley only slightly better.a few crew members rush to look over the railing.
