rob rushes forward, with chaz in reserve, pulling arch out of ∑the          way.
rob, chaz and arch jump after to help, but the ferryman pushes them          angrily away.

chaz turns quickly back to the door, reaches for the handle,          stops himself, thinks better of it and moves away again.
