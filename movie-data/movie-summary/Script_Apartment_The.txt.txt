dreyfuss            slow down, kid.he starts into the rear apartment as bud closes the door.int.
now like i            was saying, i'm in this joint on            sixty-first -- and i think i got            lucky --                   (glances toward blonde)            -- she's a skater with the ice            show --                   (he chuckles)            -- and i thought maybe i could            bring her up for a quiet drink.bud - on phone                         bud            i'm sorry, mr.
bud            -- we never close at buddy-boy's --            looks like marilyn monroe --                   (he chuckles a la dobisch)putting on his raincoat and hat, bud opens the hall door,takes the key from the table, shoves it under the doormat.his eyes fall on the dreyfuss apartment, and there is someconcern on his face.
second floor landing - nightthe blonde and dobisch, his hands full of stingers, come upto bud's door.
bud                   (a deep breath)            well, about six months ago -- i was            going to night school, taking this            course in advanced accounting --            and one of the guys in our            department -- he lives in jersey --            he was going to a banquet at the            biltmore -- his wife was meeting            him in town, and he needed someplace            to change into a tuxedo -- so i            gave him the key    and word must            have gotten around -- because the            next thing i knew, all sorts of            guys were suddenly going to            banquets -- and when you give the            key to one guy, you can't say no to            another and the whole thing got out            of hand -- pardon me.he whips out the nasal-spray, administers a couple of quicksquirts up each nostril.
bud            so do i -- i'm going to take four            aspirins and get into bed -- so you            better give the tickets to somebody            else --                         sheldrake            i'm not just giving those tickets,            baxter -- i want to swap them.
sheldrake            you don't know what it's like --            standing next to you in that            elevator, day after day -- good            morning, miss kubelik -- good            night, mr.
sheldrake            you know my secretary -- miss            olsen --                         bud            oh, yes.
bud            miss kubelik.the doors slide open again, and fran looks out.
bud            miss kubelik.fran turns away from miss olsen.
miss olsen            always happy to do something for            our girls in uniform.she moves off as bud joins fran, who is looking a little pale.
she is fullydressed, still in her coat, and apparently asleep.bud steps into the bedroom, closing the door behind him,walks over to fran.
dreyfuss takes fran into the bathroom.bud loses no time getting into the kitchen.
dreyfuss            you know, baxter, you're a real            cutie-pie -- yes, you are.bud just stands there, taking it.
fran            i don't know.bud is coming back with the coffee.
dreyfuss;                   improvising rapidly)            i told you we had a fight -- that's            what it was about -- miss olsen --            you know that other girl you saw --                         fran                   (still trying to                   figure out bud's presence)            i don't understand --                         bud            it's not important, fran -- the            main thing is that i got here in            time -- and you're going to be all            right --                   (to dr.
sheldrake -- i kept your            name out of it so there'll be no            trouble, police-wise or newspaper-            wise --as bud continues talking on the phone, fran, in the bedroom,opens her eyes, looks around vaguely, trying to figure outwhere she is.
bud                   (into phone)            -- you see, the doctor, he's a            friend of mine -- we were very            lucky in that respect -- actually,            he thinks she's my girl -- no, he            just jumped to the conclusion --            around here, i'm known as quite a            ladies' man --in the bedroom fran, becoming aware of bud's voice, crawlsout of bed and holding on to the furniture, moves unsteadilytoward the living room door.
bud                   (into phone)            -- of course, we're not out of the            woods yet -- sometimes they try it            again -- yes sir, i'll do my            best -- it looks like it'll be a            couple of days before she's fully            recovered, and i may have a little            problem with the landlady --behind him, fran appears in the bedroom doorway, barefootedand in her slip.
fran            i didn't know -- i had no idea this            was your apartment --                         bud                   (putting his arm                   around her)            let me help you.he leads her back into the bedroom.
fran            open it.bud tears open the envelope, takes out sheldrake's hundreddollars.
fran            as one woman to another -- i'm sure            she'll understand --                         bud            miss kubelik, i don't think that's            such a good idea.he gently takes the pad and pencil away from her.
bud            miss kubelik!meanwhile fran has appeared from the bathroom, and isapproaching the bedroom door.
bud            good night, miss kubelik.fran walks toward the revolving doors.
