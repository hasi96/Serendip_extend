terry walks over and leans against the flamed car, imitating                steve who pays him no mind.
steve                and terry watch curt henderson get out.
terry looks sour and turns                around to steve who's getting out of the chevy.
steve                         terry, i'm going to let you take                          care of my car while we're away--at                          least until christmas.
laurie watches terry, realizing that like the car, she'll be                left behind as a fond memory.
terry                         hey, curt, let's bomb around, i wanna                          try out my new wheels!
curt                         i'd like to, toad, but i'm going                          with steve and laurie to the hop.
traveling g street-steve's white '58 chevy               the rock and roll blares as terry the toad cruises along the                main drag, singing along with the music.
terry looks away, wondering why this is                still happening to him, even in his new car.
wolfman cuts into "why do fools fall in love." curt is                laughing in the back of the car, as he listens to the ever-               present d.j.
i think                          she said, "i love you."               curt looks at his sister and steve in the front seat.
cruising g street-steve's '58 chevy               terry continues to cruise the main drag, slouched low and                looking cool in his newly acquired machine.
the car next to him is a '56                ford--a good opponent and besides, the kid driving looks                younger than terry.
cruising main street--steve's '58 chevy               terry is looking and feeling like he's got it made.
as the radio blares "almost grown," terry glides past the                lighted stores slowly, taking in everything with wide eyes                from his beautiful new car.
steve opens the door to the car and then turns laurie and                kisses her.
and the wolfman goes into an insane rain-dance rhythm as we                hear "little darlin'"               cruising main street--steve's '58 chevy               terry not only looks cool now, but is cool, singing with the                radio, a girl beside him.
cruising g street--'32 yellow deuce coupe               john is driving and the wolfman is howling on the radio while                carol is having the time of her life.
she looks around, sitting up so maybe some of her friends                will see her in john's neat car.
cruising main street--'32 yellow deuce coupe               john roars along looking for her until he sees her walking                angrily along the sidewalk--being followed by a ford full of                guys.
the wolfman's gravelly voice whispers over the airwaves as                john and carol drive out of the shadowy car grave-yard.
cruising main street--pharoahs' '51 mercury               the radio blares "ain't that a shame?" as curt sits in the                back seat of the car looking very nervous.
debbie comes up and watches terry look heavenward.
steve goes off and debbie looks at terry.
terry and debbie look startled as they see the pharoah's                mercury roaring by--and curt leaning out the door, shouting                insanely.
terry                         it's--oh my god--it looks like steve's                          car.
john looks up--laurie is in the car with falfa.
john nods, then looks up at terry.
curt goes to terry and john.
curt looks at john and they don't seem to know what to say.
